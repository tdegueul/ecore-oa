Playing a bit with Ecore vs ObjectAlgebras

* [exps](./exps): First experiment on a simple expression language (+, *, x).
* [fsm](./fsm): A more advanced experiment on object algebra using state machines. 

To be done
----------

- [ ] Write a simple example showing the "double-denotation" style to define "abstract OAs" and reuse legacy languages that have no relation one to the other
- [ ] Write a simple example of model transformation written in OA-style
- [ ] Write a simple example showing the problem raised by the presence of type groups when ASTs are reifed
